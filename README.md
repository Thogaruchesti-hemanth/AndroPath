## 💡 Tips to Boost GitHub Popularity

1. Add **sample projects** for each stage (small apps for RecyclerView, Firebase, Jetpack Compose, etc.)
2. Include **screenshots or GIF demos** in README
3. Add **badges** for build status, Firebase, stars, and forks
4. Keep the **roadmap up-to-date** with new Android features
5. Make sections **clickable** with anchors for easy navigation
